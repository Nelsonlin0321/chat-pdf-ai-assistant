// as the best practice, we should make sure that there
// is only a single instance of this running our application.
// So the reason we are doing this in this file is because the first time
// this client file is imported somewhere in out application, we get a new instance of this Prisma
// but the second time this file is imported, this code is not re-executed, it's cached, so the result will be reused.
// Not, in Next.js because we have fast refresh, anytime we change our source codes,Next.js
// refreshes some of our modules. In that case, we will end up in a situation where we have too many Prisma clients.
// This only happens in development mode.
